# USB-Rubber-Ducky-Discord-Token-Grabber
## USE ETHICALLY I am in no way responsible inproper use of this script. ONLY USE ON YOUR OWN DEVICES OR WITH PEOPLE YOU HAVE CONSENT FROM!
This script will steal discord tokens via chrome and send them to via discord webhook. I built this with a Pi-Pico-Ducky, though a Hak5 USB Rubber-Ducky will also work. 
Guereak's [script](https://github.com/Guereak/USBDuckyScripts/blob/main/duckytokengrabber.txt) doesnt seem to work anymore but it was used as inspiration for this project and helped out alot.

## Instructions:
** Get Discord Webhook URL**
1. Create a discord server
2. Open Server Settings
3. CLick `integrations` 
4. Click `Webhooks`
5. Create a new webhook by clicking `New Webhook`
6. Click `Copy Webhook URL` to copy the webhook URL
7.In line 98 of *payload.txt*, replace `WEBHOOK URL GOES HERE` with the webhook URL
8. You're set! Load onto device and start grabbing tokens!
